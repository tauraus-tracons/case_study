Create a master branch where the core code will be there(i.e Source code)
If there are more developing teams create features for each team (i.e dev,test,prod)
Each feature will have the source code within them.
If each team have many persons we can create their own feature.
Once the change is completed and committed each user needs to create a pull request in github to merge with the master branch after reviewing.
Once the reviewer see the changes and approves it. Then the reviwer or admin will merge the change with the master.
Once it is deployed in dev environment it will be pushed to test environment and to prod
If we are facing any issue in prod environment will create a hot fix and will deploy.
Then the hotfix and any changes in the prod should be rebased to test environment for further develpment.
Then the changes in test should be rebased to dev environment too.
Like this the development will go on.
